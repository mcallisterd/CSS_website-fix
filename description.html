  <h1>Some features and the design thoughts behind our CSS</h1>
  <div class="explain">
    <h3>The theme is based on <em>Traditional Chinese Paintings</em></h3>
    <p>Every traditional Chinese painting has an inscription and a red stamp on the side of the work.</p>
    <img class="explain" src="explain.png">
  </div>
  <div class="more">
    
  <ol>
  <li>
    To imitate the style of inscriptions in Chinese paintings, 
    we rotate the "home page" and "classmates" banners 90 degrees to the right and fix them in the window. 
    By doing this, the banners display vertically, and appear like inscriptions.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    To imitate stamps, every link or clickable button changes color to that of a stamp (orange)
    when they are moused over.
    </li>
  
  <li>
    When your mouse is on any link or button you can click on, 
    it will <b>change to a butterfly</b>, which are often found in Chinese paintings.
    </li>

  <li>
    You will also notice that titles and names have special dotted borders, imatating the trace of
    a brush used for Chinese calligraphy.
    </li>
   
  <li>
  The boxes on the home page, i.e. the PREP box, CURRENT box, and COMPLETE box,
    each have a different background image in order to allow them to be more easily 
    differentiated. Also, the COMPLETE boxes are on a different vertical line compared
    to the others, so the current and prep boxes can be easily distinguished.
    </li>
  
    <li>
    For text, such as the assignment descriptions for preprs, we added a white background color
      that has lowered opacity, adding to the readability of the text while preserving the aesthetic
      appeal of the background.
