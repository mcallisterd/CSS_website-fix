  <h1>Here is some features and design thoughts of our css</h1>
  <div class="explain">
    <h3>The theme is <em>Traditional Chinese Painting</em></h3>
    <p>Every traditional Chinese painting has inscribe and red stamp on the side of work</p>
    <img class="explain" src="explain.png">
  </div>
  <div class="more">
  <p>1. To imitate inscribe, we turn "home page" and "classmates" 90 degrees and fixed it on window. So that it will display vertically, just looks like inscribe.</p>

  <p>2.To imitate stamps, every link or button you can click on will change its color to stamps' color (orange) when your mouse focus.</p>

  <p>3. When your mouse focus on every link or button you can click on, it will <b>change to a butterfly</b>, which is found on aa Chinese Painting.</p>

  <p>4. You can notice that for titles and names, we use special dotted borders arounded to imitate Chinese brush trace</p>

  <p>5. PREP box, CURRENT box, and COMPLETE box have different background image, so you can know which one is which</p>

<p>6.COMPLETE boxes are on different vertical line compare with the other two</p>
  <p>7.For text you need to read, we put white background color but with opacity, so that it will not cover background image but also easy to read.</p>
